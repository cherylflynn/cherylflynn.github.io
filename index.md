## About Me
I am a statistics and data science researcher for the AT&T Chief Data Office.  I am interested in problems related to responsible AI, data privatization, network modeling, model selection, and unsupervised learning.  

I received my PhD in Statistics from New York University in 2014 under the supervision of Cliff Hurvich, Patrick Perry, and Jeff Simonoff.

Prior to that I received my BA in Economics and Mathematics from McGill University.
